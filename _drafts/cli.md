title: Command-line Interface
---

First post and we start already with "that thing". Why? Because I use that thing to write posts like this one and I thought about sharing my limited wisdom.
Also, if I ever make another tutorial it will probably use the command line. 

I know... Command line can look scary, and if you see some one using it you might even feel tempted to call the police. 

So why should you use it?


 - System requirements

   At the moment my CPU (Pentium Dual-Core G3258 4.2GHz) sits around 3% usage while RAM is at 696MB.

 - Easier to automate (with Scripts)

   It should be easy to automate any application that can be controlled from the command line, improving your productivity.
For example, you can make a script that runs unit tests and only 'submits' changes if they were successful.

 - Speed

   You will become faster if you don't have to rely on your mouse. Also it's usually faster to write a single command instead of multiple clicks in different screen coordinates.

 - Remote Control

   Remote control is pretty trivial. Currently there are remote tools for GUI's too but bandwidth and latency costs are incomparable.

In summary: a fast, powerful and productive environment that can run almost anywhere.

The Cons (we have to make this post fair)

 - Beginner unfriendly

   There's a reason why most people are afraid of it.

 - Keyboard reliant 

   Good luck using command-line in device without a real keyboard.

 - Some applications just benefit from a GUI

   There's no denying that it's easier to edit an image from a GUI.

Now, don't think I'm saying "You must use the command-line!".
No, my goal with this post is only showing you why it is useful and why you shouldn't be afraid of using it.
