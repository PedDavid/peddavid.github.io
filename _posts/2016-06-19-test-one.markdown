This is my first try at making a post.
I will be lazy and mostly copy from jekyll automated first post.

So here is a code snippet with the (powerful)tool that jekyll says to support:
(but now in a language that I actually know):

{% highlight java %}
public static void main(String[] args){
    //Start with the classic
    System.out.println("Hello World of WebDeveloping and Jekyll! #hosted by github");
    //End with java 8 Goodness
    Arrays.asList(args).forEach(System.out::println);
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you have any questions, I bet I have even more for now...

**PS:** Before commiting I checked the page, I have to admit the code looks pretty cool... so let's check some cpp

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>
int main(){
    std::cout << "Hello World of powerful code snippet tools" << std::endl;
    /* Comment to say that I don't know much more of cpp... I could show of
     *  some pointer arithmetic though... nah... too much work... and besides
     *  mine isn't even that good...
     */
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}
